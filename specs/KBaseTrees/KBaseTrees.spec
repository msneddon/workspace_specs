    the contig sequence id is added.  Note that trees are typically built with protein sequences OR
    contig sequences. If you select one type of sequence, but the tree was built with the other type, then
    no labels will be added.  'best_feature_id' is used in the frequent case where a protein sequence has

    how they are returned.  'none' indicates that no bootstrap values are returned. 'internal_node_labels'
    indicates that bootstrap values are returned as internal node labels.  Default value is 'internal_node_labels';
    
    The 'newick_distance' key allows control over whether distance labels are generated or not.  If set to
