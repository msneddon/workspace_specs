/*
KBase Narrative Object definition.

A Narrative document wraps an IPython notebook version 3 JSON doc so it also
contains one or more possible metadata fields.

These are a mix of required and non-required fields. Those that extend the 
IPython document just incorporate into its own unspecified metadata field. These
mainly include Narrative front-end components, such as widget state, that might
differ between different widgets or implementations.

Currently, the only required field in the Narrative object (that wraps the Notebook
object) is a list of data dependencies. This is a list of Workspace references 
to other Workspace objects on which the Narrative relies.


Here is an trivial example narrative doc that contains a single empty code cell
{
    # The Notebook component
    {
        nbformat: 3
        nbformat_minor: 0,
        metadata: 
        {
            format: "ipynb",
            creator: "kbasetest",
            ws_name: "kbasetest_home",
            name: "Untitled",
            type: "Narrative",
            description: "",
            data_dependencies: [ ]
        },
                cells: 
                [
                    {
                        collapsed: false,
                        input: "",
                        outputs: [ ],
                        language: "python",
                        metadata: { },
                        cell_type: "code"
                    }
                ],
    },
    # The Narrative component
    dependencies: [ ]
}

The most minimal Narrative object available. This is useful, for example, as a template:

{
    {
        nbformat: 4
        nbformat_minor: 0,
        metadata: { },
        cells: [ ]
    },
    dependencies: [ ]
}
